Hello,

<% if @abuse.ddos.block_type_id == 3 -%>We regret to inform you that inbound traffic to <%= @abuse.ddos.domain_port %> was blocked from a certain number of IP addresses.<% else -%>We regret to inform you that <%= @abuse.ddos.domain_port %> was blocked by ha-proxy.<% end -%> The mentioned measures were applied in order to cease a DDoS attack that was causing a considerable impact on the server performance.

FYI: DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) is a network attack against a particular machine (separate server or network) intended to cause service interruptions. The attack is usually performed via a high amount of simultaneous queries to a particular website or IP address.

The status of the attack will be checked by our Technical team in 24 hours and the block will be lifted in case of a successful outcome. We will inform you accordingly.

Your patience is highly appreciated.
